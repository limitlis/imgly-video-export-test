# IMGLY ASSETS NOTICE 

## When updating the version of imgly that is pulled from the CDN you'll need to also update these assets

The assets can be found most easily by installing a local version of the npm package `npm i @cesdk/cesdk-js`. Also best if it is in a new/separate project to avoid any issues with dependency versions.

[Browse the files on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cesdk/cesdk-js?activeTab=code):
